## DR-TVFC(Distributed Robust Time-Varying Formation Control) of MASs under Disturbances

by **Guang-Ze Yang $^1$** and **Zi-Jiang Yang $^2$**

> **Abstract:** This work considers the problem of time-varying formation tracking control of second-order multi-agent systems under disturbances. The DR-TVFC(distributed robust time-varying formation control) is proposed including **distributed finite-time estimators of the leader’s states** and **sliding mode time-varying formation controllers**. Firstly, each agent can quickly estimate the leader’s states through the communication network in the distributed finite-time estimators based on the sliding mode estimation. Secondly, utilizing the estimates of the leader’s states, a sliding mode time-varying formation controller is designed using **the prescribed time modification function**. Unlike traditional distributed control law relying on the exchanges of the agents’ states, the proposed control design achieves great robustness and stability of the overall system by **exchanging the estimates of the leader’s states**. According to Lyapunov stability analysis, we prove that the proposed approach enables the sliding variables to achieve fast finite-time convergence. Furthermore, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the performance.

This work has been accepted by 2024 63rd Annual Conference of SICE.
